                    <h1>Red Riding Hood</h1>
                    <p>As soon as Wolf began to feel
                    That he would like a decent meal,
                    He went and knocked on Grandma's door.
                    When Grandma opened it, she saw
                    The sharp white teeth, the horrid grin,
                    And Wolfie said, ``May I come in?''
                    Poor Grandmamma was terrified,
                    ``He's going to eat me up!'' she cried.
                    And she was absolutely right.
                    He ate her up in one big bite.
                    But Grandmamma was small and tough,
                    And Wolfie wailed, ``That's not enough!
                    I haven't yet begun to feel
                    That I have had a decent meal!''
                    He ran around the kitchen yelping,
                    ``I've
                    got to have a second helping!''
                    Then added with a frightful leer,
                    ``I'm therefore going to wait right here
                    Till Little Miss Red Riding Hood
                    Comes home from walking in the wood.''
                    He quickly put on Grandma's clothes,
                    (Of course he hadn't eaten those).
                    He dressed himself in coat and hat.
                    He put on shoes, and after that
                    He even brushed and curled his hair,
                    Then sat himself in Grandma's chair.
                    In came the little girl in red.
                    She stopped. She stared. And then she said,
                    ``What great big ears you have, Grandma.''
                    ``All the better to hear you with,'' the Wolf replied.
                    ``What great big eyes you have, Grandma.''
                    said Little Red Riding Hood.
                    ``All the better to see you with,'' the Wolf replied.</p>
